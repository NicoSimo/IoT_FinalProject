# PROG_FINAL
My project for my IoT Final Exam.
It simulates a scenario in which a Company owns 4 different electrical vehicles and tracks their movements.
The vehicles communicate with the company thanks to a connection made with the CoAP protocol. Whenever the battery of one of the vehicles hits a certain threshold, the coordinates of a fixed charger are sent and the vehicle heads to the charger to recharge the battery.
